// Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript 
// code outside a web browser( on server).


// Ryan Dahl(Node JS creator) used Chrome's V8 engine( which used to run JS code in the web browser) inside a C++ program and created an executable.
// Now this executable can run on a cumputer/server.

 
console.log("Hello")

// We can run this js file using command 'node filename'

// In node.Js a single thread can manage multiple connections. This becomes possible because of non-blocking IO model of JS.

// To create a directory as node JS project - follow the contents of directory: npmNode
